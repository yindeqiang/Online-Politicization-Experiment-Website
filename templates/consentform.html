            Brief introduction of the experiment procedure
        </h3>

        {% if quiz_type == 'pilot_1' %}
            <p>
                If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned with two other participants to form a group of three, and will answer 10 questions about your own attitudes towards some public issues. After answering each question, all the participants' answers will be disclosed to each other. After the experiment, you will be asked to place yourself and the other two participants on an ideology spectrum. Therefore, please be aware of the other two participants' answers. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
            </p>
        {% elif quiz_type == 'pilot_2' %}
            <p>
                In this survey, you will be asked 27 questions on your ideology, hard facts, predictions of the future, and some potentially controversial public issues.
            </p>
        {% elif quiz_type == "condition_1" %}
            <p>
                If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned to a group of three participants. You and the other two participants will answer a sequence of 6 questions on either hard facts, or future predictions, or potentially controversial issues. For each question, one participant will be randomly chosen and answer the question first. Then her/his answer, together with the question, will be disclosed to the other two participants. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
            </p>
        {% else %}
            <p>
                If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned to a group of three participants. You and the other two participants will answer a sequence of about 20 questions about hard facts, predictions of future trends, personal preferences, or attitudes towards public issues. This experiment mainly consists of two phases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In Phase 1, after answering each question, all the participants' answers will be disclosed to each other. After this phase, you will be asked about how you think of the other two participants. Your appraisals of the other two participants will <b>NOT</b> be disclosed to them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In Phase 2, for each question, one participant will be randomly chosen and answer the question first. Then her/his answer, together with the question, will be disclosed to the other two participants.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You will see detailed instructions during the experiment. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
            </p>
