            Brief introduction of the experiment procedure
        </h3>

        {% if quiz_type == 'pilot_1' %}
            <p>
                If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned with two other participants to form a group of three, and will answer 10 questions about your own attitudes towards some public issues. After answering each question, all the participants' answers will be disclosed to each other. After the experiment, you will be asked to place yourself and the other two participants on an ideology spectrum. Therefore, please be aware of the other two participants' answers. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
            </p>
        {% elif quiz_type == 'pilot_2' or quiz_type == "pilot_2_2" %}
            <p>
                In this survey, you will be asked 26 questions on your ideology, hard facts, predictions of the future, some potentially controversial public issues and some design problems.
            </p>
        {% elif quiz_type == "condition_1" %}
            <p>
                If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned to a group of three participants. You and the other two participants will answer a sequence of 6 questions on either hard facts, or future predictions, or potentially controversial issues. For each question, one participant will be randomly chosen and answer the question first. Then her/his answer, together with the question, will be disclosed to the other two participants. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
            </p>
        {% else %}
            <p>
                This experiment consists of two phases. In each phase you will answer a set of questions about hard facts, future predictions, personal preferences or attitudes towards public issues.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Phase 1 contains 10 questions. We will <b>randomly</b> draw two previous participants from the dataset of our earlier experiments. Their answers to each question will be shown to you <b>after</b> you submit your own answer.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Between Phase 1 and Phase 2, you will be asked about how you think of the two previous participants. So, please be aware of their answers in Phase 1.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In Phase 2, you will be asked 6 questions. We will randomly pick one of the two previous participants, and show you her/his answer together with each question <b>before</b> you submit your answer.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You will see detailed instructions during the experiment. In the whole process, your identity will be kept anonymous.
